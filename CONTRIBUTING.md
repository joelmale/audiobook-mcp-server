# Contributing to Audiobook MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to create the most intelligent audiobook library management system possible.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audiobook-mcp-server.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Additional Web Sources**: Integrate more book databases (Goodreads, WorldCat, etc.)
- **Enhanced Pattern Recognition**: Improve filename parsing algorithms
- **Audio Format Support**: Add support for more audio formats
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize web lookup caching and processing

### Medium Priority
- **UI Improvements**: Better error messages and user feedback
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- **Documentation**: Additional usage examples and tutorials
- **Internationalization**: Support for non-English book data

### Feature Ideas
- **Cover Art Download**: Automatically fetch and embed cover images
- **Series Auto-Detection**: Better series identification and numbering
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and merge duplicate audiobooks
- **Playlist Generation**: Create listening playlists from series
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Analytics on library organization and usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### Testing
```bash
# Run existing tests
npm test

# Add tests for new features
# Tests should go in __tests__/ directory
```

### Web API Integration
- Always implement caching for external API calls
- Add appropriate rate limiting
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Respect API terms of service

### Pattern Recognition
- New patterns should have confidence scoring
- Test with various filename formats
- Consider edge cases and special characters
- Document pattern examples in comments

## üéß Testing with Audiobook Files

### Test Data Guidelines
- **Don't commit actual audiobook files** to the repository
- Use short test files or metadata-only tests
- Create mock data for web lookup testing
- Test with various filename formats and edge cases

### Common Test Scenarios
```
# Test various filename formats
- "01 - Chapter Name.mp3"
- "Harry_Potter_1_Sorcerers_Stone.mp3"
- "hp1_jim_dale_part01.mp3"
- "Author Name - Book Title - 001.mp3"
- "messy.filename.with.dots.mp3"

# Test directory structures  
- Authors/Author Name/Book Title/
- Series/Series Name/01 - Book Title/
- Random messy structure in Temp/
```
