## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                 # Main MCP server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebLookupEngine         # Web API integration and caching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PatternRecognizer       # AI pattern detection and learning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SmartSuggestionEngine   # Intelligent recommendation system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AudiobookMCPServer      # Core server with all tool implementations
```

## üìä Data Storage

The server creates these files in your audiobook root directory:

- `.mcp_learning_data.json` - Pattern recognition and user actions
- `.mcp_user_preferences.json` - Explicit user preferences  
- `.mcp_lookup_cache.json` - Cached web lookup results (7-day expiry)

**All data stays local on your system** - no external data transmission except for web API queries.

## üîß Development

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test the built server
node dist/index.js
```

## üìã Requirements
